						<p>Just four weeks into its box office run, Deadpool 2 has officially grossed more at the box office than fellow Fox movie Logan. Heading into its fourth weekend, Deadpool 2 has grossed over $231 million domestically while Logan finished its run in the United States with $225 million.</p>
						<p>As of this writing, Logan still has the highest gross worldwide with $619 million compared to Deadpool 2's $522.9 million. With at least a few more weeks left at the box office for Ryan Reynolds' second outing as Wade Wilson, it should be a matter of when, not if, Deadpool 2 passes Logan.Even though Deadpool 2 is currently part of Fox's X-men universe, fans and cast members alike are still holding out hope for a day we'll see mutants join Marvel Studios' Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>

So if they make that mistake, they’re going to (Colossus voice) need to fight dirty."</p>
