				<h1>George RR Martin's The Ice Dragon Novel Will Become A Movie</h1>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-8">
						<p><img src="" /> For the benefit of those who are still watching previous seasons of Game Of Thrones, a mild spoiler alert. Now then, for everyone caught up: hooray! We'll get to see a fun animated movie about the madcap adventures of Viserion, the poor dragon turned into a blue-flame-breathing beast in service of the Night King. Wait, hang on... we're being told by pedants that Viserion is not an ice dragon and that the planned new film The Ice Dragon will adapt some other corner of Thrones creator George RR Martin's work. Boooo! Here's what we do know, though: Warner Animation Group has bought up the rights to Martin's 1980 book The Ice Dragon, written before he started work on Thrones, and not set in the same realm (at least according to Martin, though publishers have been happy to make the connection). Instead, the story finds a young girl named Adara, who secretly befriends a rare ice dragon. Which comes in handy when an invading army of more regular, but still deadly creatures arrives to mess with her city and only the Ice Dragon can help her stop them. </p>
