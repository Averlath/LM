									<h1 class="text-info title">George RR Martin's The Ice Dragon Novel Will Become A Movie</h1>
									<p class="datetime_published">June 3, 2018 - 3:58 PM</p>
									<p class='text-dark'><img src="https://cdn.empireonline.com/jpg/70/0/0/640/480/aspectfit/0/0/0/0/0/0/c/articles/5b05ac6cc2584c6506a3d702/george-rr-martin.jpg" class="image" alt="json image" align="left" width="300px" height="200px" />For the benefit of those who are still watching previous seasons of Game Of Thrones, a mild spoiler alert. Now then, for everyone caught up: hooray! We'll get to see a fun animated movie about the madcap adventures of Viserion, the poor dragon turned into a blue-flame-breathing beast in service of the Night King. Wait, hang on... <span id="long">we're being told by pedants that Viserion is not an ice dragon and that the planned new film The Ice Dragon will adapt some other corner of Thrones creator George RR Martin's work. Boooo! Here's what we do know, though: Warner Animation Group has bought up the rights to Martin's 1980 book The Ice Dragon, written before he started work on Thrones, and not set in the same realm (at least according to Martin, though publishers have been happy to make the connection). Instead, the story finds a young girl named Adara, who secretly befriends a rare ice dragon. Which comes in handy when an invading army of more regular, but still deadly creatures arrives to mess with her city and only the Ice Dragon can help her stop them.</span></p> <br />

									<p class="datetime_published">May 29, 2018 - 11:43 AM</p>

Heading into its fourth weekend, Deadpool 2 has grossed over $231 million domestically while Logan finished its run in the United States with $225 million. <span id="long2">As of this writing, Logan still has the highest gross worldwide with $619 million compared to Deadpool 2's $522.9 million. With at least a few more weeks left at the box office for Ryan Reynolds' second outing as Wade Wilson, it should be a matter of when, not if, Deadpool 2 passes Logan.Even though Deadpool 2 is currently part of Fox's X-men universe, fans and cast members alike are still holding out hope for a day we'll see mutants join Marvel Studios' Marvel Cinematic Universe.</span></p><br /><br />

What happened next was not immediately clear. Did the two compact bodies merge to become a single, more massive neutron star? Or did the merger produce a black hole? <span id="long3">Astronomers using NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory to study the aftermath said it appears the merger resulted in the lowest mass black hole ever discovered.
									“We may have answered one of the most basic questions about this dazzling event – what did it make?” said Pawan Kumar of the University of Texas at Austin, co-author of a paper describing the observations. “Astronomers have long suspected that neutron star mergers would form a black hole and produce bursts of radiation, but we lacked a strong case for it until now.”</span></p>
