									<h1 class="text-info title">George RR Martin's The Ice Dragon Novel Will Become A Movie</h1>
									<p class="datetime_published">June 3, 2018 - 3:58 PM</p>
									<p class='text-dark'><img src="https://cdn.empireonline.com/jpg/70/0/0/640/480/aspectfit/0/0/0/0/0/0/c/articles/5b05ac6cc2584c6506a3d702/george-rr-martin.jpg" class="image" alt="json image" align="left" width="300px" height="200px" />For the benefit of those who are still watching previous seasons of Game Of Thrones, a mild spoiler alert. Now then, for everyone caught up: hooray! We'll get to see a fun animated movie about the madcap adventures of Viserion, the poor dragon turned into a blue-flame-breathing beast in service of the Night King. Wait, hang on... <span id="long">we're being told by pedants that Viserion is not an ice dragon and that the planned new film The Ice Dragon will adapt some other corner of Thrones creator George RR Martin's work. Boooo! Here's what we do know, though: Warner Animation Group has bought up the rights to Martin's 1980 book The Ice Dragon, written before he started work on Thrones, and not set in the same realm (at least according to Martin, though publishers have been happy to make the connection). Instead, the story finds a young girl named Adara, who secretly befriends a rare ice dragon. Which comes in handy when an invading army of more regular, but still deadly creatures arrives to mess with her city and only the Ice Dragon can help her stop them.</span></p> <br />

									<p class="datetime_published">May 29, 2018 - 11:43 AM</p>

Heading into its fourth weekend, Deadpool 2 has grossed over $231 million domestically while Logan finished its run in the United States with $225 million. <span id="long2">As of this writing, Logan still has the highest gross worldwide with $619 million compared to Deadpool 2's $522.9 million. With at least a few more weeks left at the box office for Ryan Reynolds' second outing as Wade Wilson, it should be a matter of when, not if, Deadpool 2 passes Logan.Even though Deadpool 2 is currently part of Fox's X-men universe, fans and cast members alike are still holding out hope for a day we'll see mutants join Marvel Studios' Marvel Cinematic Universe.</span></p><br /><br />

									<h1 class="text-info title">Men in Black Spinoff Offered A Role To Kumail Nanjiani</h1>
									<p class="datetime_published">May 17, 2018 - 5:06 PM</p>
									<p class='text-dark'><img src="https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Kumail-Nanjiani-in-The-Big-Sick.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=798&h=407" class="image" alt="json image" align="left" width="300px" height="200px" />Kumail Nanjiani has reportedly been offered a sidekick role in the upcoming Men in Black spinoff starring Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson. It began life as cult comic book published by Aircel Comics in the early 1990s, then went on to become a smash hit movie franchise starring Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. <span id="long3">Now, Men in Black will return to screens in a spinoff film with all-new lead characters. Sony's rebooted Men in Black will still take place in the original films' same sci-fi universe, where humans live alongside aliens, and secret agents called the Men in Black take care of law and order. But Smith and Jones will step aside as a new pair of heroes takes over. Hemsworth steps into one of the lead slots, playing the suave-but-goofy Agent H. He'll be joined by Tessa Thompson as Molly, a young woman who believes in aliens and wants to join the MiB. Liam Neeson was recently added to the cast as the leader of the British MiB.</span></p><br />
