						<p>Gravitational waves and high-energy gamma rays from the merger of two neutron stars swept through Earth’s solar system, detected by the LIGO and NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. What happened next was not immediately clear. Did the two compact bodies merge to become a single, more massive neutron star? Or did the merger produce a black hole? Astronomers using NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory to study the aftermath said it appears the merger resulted in the lowest mass black hole ever discovered.</p>
						<p>“We may have answered one of the most basic questions about this dazzling event – what did it make?” said Pawan Kumar of the University of Texas at Austin, co-author of a paper describing the observations. “Astronomers have long suspected that neutron star mergers would form a black hole and produce bursts of radiation, but we lacked a strong case for it until now.”</p>
						<p>The gravitational waves detected by LIGO indicated the mass of the post-merger body, known as GW170817, was about 2.7 solar masses, making it either the most massive neutron star ever found or the lowest-mass black hole. The least-massive black holes found previously weighed in at four to five times the sun’s mass.</p>
						<p>If the merger detected by LIGO and Fermi resulted in a more massive neutron star, the signal should indicate a very rapid rotation and a strong magnetic field, resulting in an expanding cloud of high-energy debris and X-ray emissions. But that is not what Chandra detected. The data showed X-ray levels up to several hundred times lower than expected.</p>
